# ITGPS2 stuff

Some tools to assist with hacking of the PS2 version of In The Groove. The repository currently consists of:
* songconv.py - converts songs for compatibility with ITGPS2 (replace rolls with holds in simfiles, rescale images, reencode audio into 48KHz OGG Vorbis, etc). WIP
* rage_mp3_reader - MP3 decoding program. Uses code ripped out of the StepMania engine to keep sync accurate for Vorbis reencoding
